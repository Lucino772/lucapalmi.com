### Description
This website allows me to showcase my skills but also the way I approach each project that I do. It’s built with modern technology and aims to be available for every platform. Hopefully this website will grow into becoming an entrypoint for everything that I do, whether it’s projects, blogs, research, etc.

### Goals/Objectives
The primary goal of this website is to provide a way for me to showcase projects that I’ve made. I also use this website as a sandbox environment for learning about web technologies and improving my skills in web design. 

### Challenges
The whole website was a challenge for me, I had never done a website before and I had to learn a lot specially from a design point of view. I started by doing the design on paper but then after some research I stumbled on [Figma] and I realised that it would be a tool that will be very useful in the future. I still use [Figma] to this day as a tool for prototyping and more.

### My role
As the only developer on this project, I designed the website from scratch and then transformed that design into an actual website. As someone who had always worked with backend technologies, I decided that maybe I should improve my frontend skills and focus on the conceptual design more than on the actual code.

### Technologies used
The website is built with [Next.js] and [Tailwind CSS][TailwindCSS]. I decided to go with [Next.js] instead of plain [React][NextVsReact] mainly due to SEO. I also decided to not wander off too much from classic CSS and choose to use a utility-first library like [Tailwind CSS][TailwindCSS]. 

The website was initially deployed on [DigitalOcean][HostWebsiteOnDigitalOcean] where I had to manage the server myself and It was too much work for a simple website like this one. I then moved to [Vercel][HostWebsiteOnVercel] where I don’t need to worry about the server anymore and the website is deployed automatically.

### References:
Design being a visual thing (obviously!), a lot of the research that I did led to videos on youtube, here is a list of some youtube channel, that I still follow to this day, which helped me in discovering technologies in the frontend world:
